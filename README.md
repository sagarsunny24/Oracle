# Oracle: A Non-Invasive Eeg Based Brain Computer Interface For Digital Device Control
Oracle is a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) project that allows users to control a digital image carousel using two distinct input methods powered by the Muse 2 headset:

- **Motor Imagery (EEG-based)**: Uses left/right motor imagery signals detected from brain activity.
- **Accelerometer-based Control**: Uses head movement (tilt left/right) captured from Muse 2â€™s onboard accelerometer.

This project aims to provide a low-latency, user-friendly interface for hands-free digital interaction, especially for assistive technology applications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Real-time image carousel navigation
- Two control modes:
  - **EEG Motor Imagery** via EEG-ITNet deep learning model
  - **Head Tilt Detection** via Muse 2 accelerometer
- Live confidence feedback and smooth transitions (Pygame interface)
- Modular, readable codebase for each control type
